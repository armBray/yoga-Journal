        title: "Yoga for the morning and evening: which practice to choose and why",
        date: "december 1, 2023",
        description: "What is the best time of day to do yoga, and why should morning practice be distinct from evening practice? These are two questions that I hear asked quite frequently, especially by those who are approaching the practice of yoga for the first time. In fact, the time of day you decide to unroll your mat, and the type of yoga you choose to practice, can make a big difference in our experience, and in the benefits we can get. ...and that's certainly the case: every moment of the day, in fact, has its own peculiar characteristics, and this is why there are specific yoga styles for the morning and the evening. In this article we will try to understand together the characteristics of each practice, both from a yoga and Ayurveda point of view.",

                subTitle: "Why does every moment of the day have its own yoga",
                paragraph: "The presence or absence of sunlight are two factors that for a very long part of our evolution have been decisive in establishing the rhythms of our life; this is still the case today, obviously, even if the advent of electricity and the possibility of brightly lighting our homes at any time of the day have substantially changed the experience we have of the sleep/wake alternation. However, it remains implicit in our nature that we feel more active in the morning and tired in the evening, after a long day spent between work and various commitments. Our body, in fact, follows the so-called 'circadian rhythms', i.e. biological cycles that are based on sunlight and which influence a vast range of physiological processes, including sleep, digestion and metabolism. Well, yoga and Ayurveda can be used to help us harmonize circadian rhythms and improve our overall health. And just like the sun reaches that its peak at midday and then sets again towards the evening, the practice of yoga should maintain the same 'energetic' logic. In fact, every moment of the day has a different energy, just think of how we feel when we wake up in the morning, or the sensations we feel when we observe a sunrise or, on the contrary, how we feel when we observe a sunset. The morning brings with it the freshness, dynamism, effervescence and curiosity of the new, for this reason, in these hours of the day, the ideal would be to dedicate ourselves to an energizing yoga practice that provides us with a good boost to do the tasks of the day with the right dose of calm, concentration and tranquility. Likewise, as the hours of the day pass, and the intensity of the sun decreases, our energy reserves are also consumed, so that, when we reach the evening, we will need a gentle practice like a sunset to help us release the stress and tensions accumulated during the day, and contribute to having a regenerating and deep sleep. For this reason there are different yoga practices that adapt to different moments of the day, such as the Sun Salutation, ideal to do in the morning, and the Moon Salutation, ideal to do in the evening. (We'll talk about both in a bit.) As for Ayurveda, it is based on the theory that the three doshas (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) regulate the functioning of our body and mind. Each dosha has its own unique qualities and its activity is greater at certain times of the day. Let's look at them one at a time"

                subTitle: "From 2am to 6am and from 2pm to 6p",
                paragraph: "In this time slot the Vata dosha predominates, which regulates the movement and activity of the nervous system. This element is associated with mental activity and thought, therefore making these hours of the day particularly favorable for the practice of yoga and meditation. At this time, generally, the quality of the mind is purer, since there are no thoughts of the day, and the energy is more conductive to inducing the state of meditation. It is also for this reason that if you go to an Ashram in India, you will most likely have to wake up at 5 in the morning to meditate. "

                subTitle: "From 10am to 2pm and from 10pm to 2am",
                paragraph: "In this time slot, the Pitta dosha predominates, which regulates metabolism and digestion. This time slot is particularly beneficial for working on the digestive fire, considering that it is the moment of greatest activation. Sequences to improve digestion are indicated, but only during the day; in the evening, however, by putting additional embers on the fire, you risk tossing and turning into bed all night. It is also for this reason that, during the evening time slot in which this element predominates, not only are all energizing practices not recommended, but it would also be preferable to avoid intense physical activity"

                subTitle: "From 6am to 10am and between 6pm and 10pm",
                paragraph: "In this time slot the Kapha dosha predominates, which regulates the structure of the body and the immune system. In this phase, the morning is ideal for doing intense exercise, even in the gym or for a run, while in the evening, although it is true that this dosha wants to make us move, we still need to consider the biological clock and therefore move in moderation, otherwise, as in the case of the Pitta dosha, you risk tossing and returning to bed all night"

                subTitle: "Yoga before or after meals",
                paragraph: "Another relevant indication concerns the amount of time that should pass between the last meal and the start of the practice. In this sense it is important to remember that ideally at least three hours should pass after meals before unrolling the mat, even if, in some cases, you can end up eating something, such as a banana or a smoothie, even half an hour before if perhaps it is we don't eat all day and we need energy to sustain the practice. However, there are many factors involved, from what and how we choose to eat (it is not the same thing to eat rice and vegetables or a pizza, and do it calmly or in a hurry), to what type of practice you are going to carry out, whether more or less meditative, for example, down to one's characteristics and metabolism. For these reasons, our advice is to always listen to the body's signals, learning to interpret what it tells us, starting from what you feel you need to eat for dinner, to when you feel it is time to unroll the mat, to the type of practice he needs at that moment"

        date: "january 1, 2024",
        description: "In the common imagination, yoga is considered an individual discipline, which can be practiced in a group in the context of the same room, but which remains limited, so to speak, to one's own physical, mental and emotional perceptions. In fact, it is often recommended not to speak during practice, not to observe those practicing next to us, and to remain focused on what happens inside us, rather than worrying about what happens around us. In reality the objective of yoga is to create union and sharing (the word yoga literally means union), not only between our body and our mind, but also between us and the people who are close to us, such as our partner, our family, and the community in which we live. This is a result that can be achieved through individual practice, as it helps us improve the way we relate to ourselves, and consequently also to others. However, there are many yoga practices and positions that can be done as a couple, and which aim to help us create a deep connection with the person we are practicing with, thus helping us to understand and erase the sense of separation from the other. , and instead contributing a sort of physical, mental, emotional and energetic union. The benefits of practicing yoga as a couple are truly many, and for this reason we decided to write this article and share a series of basic and advanced positions that you can practice as a couple, and some practical advice on how to get started.",

        description: "When we human beings were at the dawn of our evolution, and lived in the African jungles, without any form of protection, that of sleeping was for a long time one of the most contradictory and dangerous needs with which we had to learn to live: by sleeping, in fact, our senses fall asleep, we become unaware of what is happening around us, and consequently vulnerable to all kinds of dangers, both environmental and animal. Yet, despite this extremely risky condition for our evolution, Mother Nature has imposed on us the need to spend almost a third of our existence sleeping, and to have to do so regularly every day if we want our organism to function properly. In fact, during sleep, numerous and wonderful biological processes occur: the brain acquires new information and gets rid of toxins, nerve cells communicate with each other and reorganize themselves, and the body regenerates and repairs our cells, rebalancing the levels of energy and releasing numerous molecules, such as hormones and proteins.",

        date: "ferbuary 14, 2024",
        description: "Purification and purification are two concepts of which it is very easy to find traces in most oriental disciplines, including yoga, Ayurveda and meditation. But why? The answer is simple: because we human beings, like all other living beings on earth, need to constantly free ourselves from all the toxins we produce while living... and it is for this reason that, over the millennia, our body has evolved to autonomously carry out all the biological processes necessary to eliminate our production waste. (For example, emitting carbon dioxide through respiration, emitting water-soluble toxins through urine, and emitting solid waste through digestion.) However, there are times when our body, especially during seasonal changes, after convalescence, or after a particularly intense and difficult period on an emotional level, needs to be supported and helped in this process of eliminating accumulated waste. This help is extremely necessary also because, as often happens, our lifestyle, stress, lack of attention to nutrition, smoking, pollution, and so on and so forth, contribute to intensifying the quantity of purification work that our body must carry out, with the result that in certain moments of our life our organs are no longer able to bear all the work we give them to do... and that's when the various problems linked to excesses begin to appear of toxins. Fortunately, both yoga and Ayurveda have a lot to teach us about how to help our body dispose of excess toxins (or prevent them from forming), and in this article we will delve into the different facets of purification from a of yoga, Ayurveda and meditation.",

An example is our good old immune system. In fact, too often we forget about its existence and its importance, and we find ourselves running for cover only when our health is compromised and we can no longer pretend nothing has happened. In some ways it is normal for this to be the case, if only because the society in which we have grown up has taught us since we were children that it is much easier to take a pill when we are feeling ill, rather than making preventive efforts which imply some small sacrifices.",

And even in yoga the theme of the menstrual cycle is rather recent compared to the millenary tradition of this discipline. In fact, in the sacred texts, the topic is not contemplated because yoga was originally reserved for men, therefore the specific indications and guides for practicing during the special conditions of women began with the arrival of yoga in the West.
