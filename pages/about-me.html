                <h1>Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my yoga journal.</h1>
                <p>Yoga Roku is a yoga journal where people can expand their personal growth, yoga knowledge, and deepen
                    their yoga practice in a safe and welcoming environment.

            <h3>Flow</h3>
            <p>
                This hatha based class utilizes the concept of vinyasa (flow) as the basis to build up strength slowly
                over time to increase the depth of practice for the participant. With several modifications available,
                this class encourages you to attend two times per week to literally practice being with challenges. The
                class is designed to assist you in sitting with challenge and observing how your mind reacts. Simply we
                are practicing/building capacity to witness the mind and its reactions as they are. Moving from the
                premise that the self cannot be broken, and resisting the capitalist notion that we must always be
                improving ourselves – this class asks us to sit with the challenge – exactly as it is. This will not
                change your life, it will not change you, nor do you need to be changed. We encourage you to be as you
                are – with some fun, building your capacity to witness the habit patterning of the mind without wanting
                it to change. This strength-flow class is geared toward slow and steady developments for the
                practitioner in an irreverent atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Join us for a deeply harmonious practice that embodies an array of asanas to awaken and center the body
                and mind followed by a guided meditation called Yoga Nidra. Yoga Nidra induces complete physical,
                mental, and emotional relaxation. Within this peaceful state, the mind remains awake to explore
                different states of consciousness, while stimulating rejuvenation, increasing inner strength, shifting
                limited thinking patterns, awakening creativity, and counteracting stress. Students of all experience
                levels are welcome.

            <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
            <p>
                Gentle yoga is perfect for people who want to try yoga for the first time or for those who are looking
                for a softer approach to their practice. In this class we will combine gentle yoga poses with breathing
                exercises and restorative postures to stretch and strengthen the body, reduce stress and calm the mind.
                Everybody is welcome to practice yoga in this supportive environment. No yoga experience is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                Known as the quiet practice, Yin Yoga targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis and lower
                spine. Yin postures are held for three to five minutes which gives the body an opportunity to open and
                release tension from deeper tissues. This form of yoga is a great complement to more dynamic and active
                practices, and is a great aid for learning to sit in meditation. The practice works with our energy
                body, clearing blockages in nadis (meridians) and increasing the flow of prana or chi, improving the
                health of our organs as well as increasing our energy and promoting a general sense of wellbeing. Yin
                Yoga is suitable for most levels of students.
